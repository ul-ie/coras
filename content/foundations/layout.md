<h1>{{ title }}</h1>

Page layouts are based on a 12-column responsive grid.

Different layouts can be set per breakpoint (i.e. a pre-defined device width). For a example, a layout could start out as single-column on mobile, two-column on tablet-sized devices, and three-column on desktop-sized devices.

The breakpoints we use are as follows:

| Name         | Variable | Rem Value | Pixel Value |
| ---          | ---      | ---       | ---         |
| Extra Small  | xs       | 36rem     | 576px       |
| Small        | sm       | 48rem     | 768px       |
| Medium       | md       | 64rem     | 1024px      |
| Large        | lg       | 80rem     | 1280px      |
| Extra Large  | xl       | 96rem     | 1536px      |
